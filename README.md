# **3D Medical Imaging with WebAR**

### **Project Description**
This project focuses on converting 2D medical imaging data (e.g., MRI, CT scans) into detailed 3D models and integrating them into a Web-based Augmented Reality (WebAR) platform. The system allows clinicians, researchers, and patients to intuitively explore anatomical structures in an interactive and real-time manner. By leveraging cloud computing, the project overcomes device limitations and enhances visualization, making it suitable for diagnostic, educational, and surgical planning purposes.
